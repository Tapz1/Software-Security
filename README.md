# Software-Security

The client here was Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for retirement, investments, insurance, and savings for their clients.
Their requirements were to add a file verification step to their web application that ensures secure communications. Therefore, in this secure software report, I included a data verification step in the form of a checksum and SHA-256 encryption. 

I did well when it came to selecting AES as the algorithm cipher and generating my own self-signed certificate using the Java Keytool. Overall, it's important to code securely to elminate errors and defects early on in the development cycle and elminate any potential cyber attack. I also made sure to check if there were new vulnerabilities that were introduced after refactoring the code with the implementation of my checksum. The dependency reports will prove to be vital tool and resource going forward. 

By shifting the focus in DevSecOps, you build trust with your users and a strong reputation for your overall brand while also eliminating the costs that go into resolving the results of a cyber attack. 

Going forward I plan to use a vulnerability assessment tool and commit to static testing. Using this kind of report I can better strategize for what areas of security I would be focusing on and determining any vulnerabilities early on and identifying any false positives that come along with that through dependendecny checks. The fundamental secure coding guidelines for Java SE will also be a valuable consistent point of reference as I continue in my software engineering career.
